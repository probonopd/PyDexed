# TX816 Performance Notes

Source: [Yamaha TX816 FM Tone Generator System Performance Notes](https://archive.org/details/TX-816_performance_notes_part_1_of_4/mode/2up)

The voices 1 ~ 23 in each TF1 module have been designed so that eight modules should be
performed on simultaneously, using MIDI keyboards such as the Yamaha DX7.
Connect a MIDI cable to the MIDI OUT jack of the MIDI keyboard (Yamaha DX7, etc.), and the
COMMON IN jack of the TX816, and set the modules of the TX816 to the COMMON setting.
The voices 24 ~ 32 in each module have been designed as individual voices for use together
with sequencers such as the Yamaha QX1.

The factory-loaded data have been set so that the Foot Controller, Breath Controller and Modulation Wheel can be used to control the tone, volume and modulation.
Therefore in some cases, failure to use the Foot Controller or Breath Controller may result In no sound being produced.
The operation of these effects controllers can also be edited as desired. For example, when using a voice for which the volume is controlled by the Breath Controller, you can switch the effect of the Breath Controller completely off, or you can change the controller for the volume to, say, the Foot Controller.

### 1. PIANO
For this sound, we have synthesized the individual frequency components that comprise the sound of a piano. Module 1, Module 2, Module 5 and Module 6 produce the general piano sound, while Module 3 produces a resonant bass. Module 4 produces the sound of the higher octave strings, Module 7 produces the hammer noise, and Module 8 produces the sound of the undamped high strings. These components are all combined together, resulting in a rich and realistic piano sound.

### 2. STRINGS
First enter the Modulation wheel. Module 8 will produce the sound of a solo violin. Pressing the Foot control will add the strings of Module 1 ~ Module 7 in order, resulting in a string ensemble.

### 3. CHURCH ORGAN
Normally, this sound is that of a small pipe organ. Activating the Modulation wheel turns on the CLOSED PIPE effect, while pressing down the Foot control will activate the REEDS, LOW MID PIPE and BASS PIPES effects in order, producing a rich and sonorous sound. Release the Foot control to allow the REEDS. You should be able to hear the sound of a church choir.

### 4. CHOIR
First activate the Foot control. The male BASS chorus should start up. Now activating the Modulation wheel should cause the female chorus to enter. Now blow into the Breath control, producing a large choir effect.

### 5. TRUMPETS
This sound reproduces the bright and brilliant effect of a trumpet ensemble. Adjust the volume by using the Foot control, and use the Modulation wheel to control the degree of vibrato. The PITCH BEND effect can also be used if desired.

### 6. ELECTRIC PIANO
This sound features a metallic attack noise. Real electric pianos produce this kind of noise in addition to their regular round and pearly sound. The Modulation wheel can be used to add a tremolo effect (generated by Module 1 and Module 2), while the Foot control can be used for a chorus effect (generated by Module 3 and Module 4).

### 7. CELLOS
This sound reproduces the dark and rich low frequency sound of an orchestra's cello ensemble. The Foot control can be used to produce a normal-sounding cello ensemble, while the Modulation wheel can be used to control the effect of cellos being bowed with a heavier touch.

### 8. ELECTRIC ORGAN
First activate the Foot control, producing the basic organ sound. The Module 7 sound will vary according to the initial touch. Blowing into the Breath control should produce the sound of the high four feet and two feet draw bars. The Modulation wheel can also be used to produce the effect of a rotary speaker.

### 9. HORNS
Activate the Foot control and perform with a normal touch, producing a rounded horn sound. Using a stronger initial touch will cause the sound to distort on the attacks. The Modulation wheel will make the tone quality sharper, and the Breath control can also be used to change the sound.

### 10. FILTER SYNTH
This creates the effect of the filter of an analogue synthesizer, creating a sound whereby the VCF cut-off frequency seems to be moving. First cancel the Modulation wheel, Foot control and Breath control, producing a rounded sound that is close to a sine wave. Pressing down the Foot control will increase the cut-off frequency, and activating the Modulation wheel will increase the intensity of the attack. The Breath control can be used to produce the sound of two synthesizers being played in unison, one slightly detuned from the other.

### 11. FM PIANO
This is a special Yamaha original piano sound, that only the FM tone generation system is capable of producing. Only the keyboard touch and damper functions are used. The Modulation wheel, Foot control and Breath control are not used.

### 12. 8 WAY PERCUSSION
Using the NOTE LIMIT function of the TX816, this allocates 8 different percussion sounds to the respective keys, beginning from the lower and progressing to the upper.

### 13. BASS-ELECTRIC PIANO + SPLIT
Turning down the Modulation wheel, Foot control and Breath control produces the sound of the bass on the lower keys, while the upper keys will produce the sound of a clavinet. Turning up the Modulation wheel will add the sound of the electric piano to the upper keys, while the Foot control will add the sound of an electric string bass. The Breath control will add the sound of a synthesizer bass.

### 14. E. PIANO/STRINGS/BRASS MIX
The normal mode of this voice produces the Module 1 and Module 2 electric piano sound. Pressing down on the Foot control will mix the sound of strings to the electric piano, while using the Breath control will add brass.

### 15. GUITAR-OBOE STRINGS
The Modulation wheel will split the sound of an acoustic guitar to the lower keys, while the Breath control splits the sound of an oboe to the upper keys, forming an oboe solo with guitar accompaniment. Pressing down on the Foot control will add the sound of strings across the entire frequency range.

### 16. PLUCK SPECIAL
This is a special sound, belonged to the PLUCKED sound category. Module 1 and Module 2 form the basic tensioned plucked sound, while Module 3 and Module 4 produce a pitch EG-modulated continuous sound that sounds like the attack time has been changed. The Modulation wheel can be used so that the Module 5 and Module 6 sounds are produced in alternation from the left and right channels, while the Foot control can be used to produce the Module 7 and Module 8 bell sound.

### 17. PIANO/CHOIR
Turning down the Foot control will produce the sound of an acoustic piano, while gradually pressing down on the Foot control adds the sound of a male choir.

### 18. BELL → VOICE
Turn down the Foot control. When a given key on the keyboard is pressed, first the BIG TUBES sound will be produced, and while this sound is decaying, the DREAM VOICE sound will enter. Holding the key down even longer will cause the INNER SPACE sound to be produced. Pressing down the Foot control will produce the VOICES sound. If the sustain pedal is being held down, the voices will change in order as outline above, even if the original key is released.

### 19. FALLING →
This sound reproduces the effect of glittering falling stars, followed by a slow attack sine wave synthesizer sound.

### 20. PRETTY POWER
This powerful sound is a combination of many exotic ingredients.

### 21. FULL ORCHESTRA
For this composite sound, the Foot control controls the strings sound, the Breath control controls the brass sounds, while the Modulation wheel controls the tympani. In combination, these sounds will create the sound of an orchestra.

### 22. JAZZ ORCHESTRA SPLIT
The lower keys are used for producing the sound of a plucked bass and ride cymbal. For the upper keys, the Modulation wheel controls the flutes, the Breath control controls the saxophones and the Foot control controls the trumpets and trombones. Following the flute and saxophone solos, a TUTTI performance effect can be produced.

### 23. CELLOS/HORNS
The Modulation wheel controls the cellos, while the Foot control controls the horns, for this darker and heavier sound.

### Notes

* Following 24, each individual module contains a different voice. The information for these voices are as follows.

* Modules 1 and 2 form a DOUBLE VOICE together.

### 24. AFRICAN MALLETS
This sound has a very ethnic African flavor.

### 25. PLANET OF ICE
This is a very dreamy, fantastic sound.

### 26. FLOATING CLOUDS
This sound gives the feeling of a person riding on a cloud.

### 27. GLASS WIND CHIMES
This sound has a chime effect.

### 28. HARPSICHORD
This sound is that of an orthodox harpsichord.

### 29. CLAV
This sound is that of a normal clavinet.

### 30. VIBES
The Modulation wheel can be used to reproduce the pitch vibrato effect.

### 31. DOUBLE HARP
This sound reproduces very subtle differences in the attack.

### 32. BELL TREES
Use a glissando technique for this sound. It will give a lingering effect, just like the real thing.

### Notes

* Modules 3 through 6 each contain individual wind instruments, string instruments, percussion instruments and sound effect sounds. These can be used as sounds for solo instruments when performing with a sequencer.

* Module 7 contains nine different types of bass sounds.

* Module 8 contains PERCUSSION sounds. When connecting the QX → TX816 → RX, connect the RX to THRU of module 8 on the TX816, and sound it using the channel information, and also set the NOTE LIMIT function to E3 and above, enabling the voices of module 8 to be used as well.
